# What is Nebula?

<Image img={overviewDiagram} />

[Nebula](https://github.com/CremitHQ/nebula) is a comprehensive platform for secret management, designed to support various applications and use cases. It provides a secure, scalable, and flexible solution for storing and controlling access to sensitive information across multiple domains and organizations.

- Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE) is the core cryptographic protocol used by Nebula to securely store and control access to secrets. It allows for fine-grained access control based on user attributes across multiple authorities.

- A key security feature of Nebula is its end-to-end encryption(E2EE) model. All encryption and decryption operations are performed on the client side, ensuring that sensitive data never leaves the client in an unencrypted form. This approach significantly enhances security by reducing the attack surface and eliminating the need to trust the server with unencrypted secrets.

- The Nebula protocol operates over a secure transport layer (e.g., TLS) that provides integrity, server authentication, confidentiality, and transport channel binding.

#### Nebula objectives

1. Provide a secure and decentralized secret management infrastructure for organizations and applications. This infrastructure aims to achieve the following qualities:

   - Enhanced Security: Eliminate the need for centralized key management servers, reducing the risk of single point of failure and improving overall system security.

   - Distributed Authority: Separate and distribute authority across multiple entities, enhancing security and reducing the potential impact of compromised authorities.

   - Fine-grained Access Control: Utilize attribute-based policies to enable precise control over secret access, allowing organizations to define and enforce complex access rules based on user attributes and roles.

   - Flexible Authentication: Support various authentication methods across different authorities, enabling organizations to use their preferred identity providers and authentication mechanisms.

   - Robust Validation: Validate client credentials against trusted third-party sources, similar to Vault's approach with Github, LDAP, AppRole, and others, ensuring the authenticity of access requests.

2. Offer a more secure and privacy-focused alternative to traditional centralized secret management solutions. Nebula aims to provide:

   - Improved security against potential compromises of individual authorities in the system.

   - Enhanced privacy through client-side encryption, ensuring that unencrypted secrets never leave the client.

3. Balance robust security measures with user experience, prioritizing ease of integration for developers and simplicity of use for end-users across various platforms and devices.

4. Provide a scalable and adaptable solution that can grow with organizations, supporting complex multi-domain and multi-organizational secret sharing scenarios while maintaining strict security standards.
