# Authority Configuration Guide
The Authority server is a pivotal component of Nebula, responsible for issuing user keys based on user attributes and exposing the public keys used for encryption. This guide provides a detailed explanation of the Authority configuration file, enabling you to tailor Nebula to your specific environment and requirements.

## Configuration File Overview
Below is an example of an Authority configuration file:
```toml
port = 8090
jwks_url = "http://authorization:9000/jwks"
# if you want to disarm the key shares on the startup, you can specify the key shares.
# NOTE: This is a dangerous option. Please use it only for testing or you can manage the key shares securely.
# disarm_key_shares = ["...key1...", "...key2...", ...]

[backbone]
host = "http://backbone:8080"

[storage]
type = "POSTGRES"
host = "db"
port = 5432
database_name = "postgres"
auth.method = "CREDENTIAL"
auth.username = "postgres"
auth.password = "password"

[authority]
name = "Authority" # Change this to the name of your authority
```

This configuration file is written in [TOML](https://toml.io/) format and is divided into several sections.

---

## Configuration Details

### Port
`port` specifies the port on which the Authority server listens for incoming requests.

### (Optional) Path Prefix
`path_prefix` specifies the path prefix for the Authorization server. This is useful when the Authorization server is behind a reverse proxy or load balancer.

```toml
path_prefix = "/auth"
```

### JWKs URL Configuration
`jwks_url` where the Authorization server exposes its [JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517) endpoint.

:::note
Ensure that the `jwks_url` is accessible from the Backbone server.
:::

### (Optional) JWKs Refresh Interval
`jwks_refresh_interval` specifies the interval (in seconds) at which the server revalidates the JWKs from the authorization server.
- Default: `10` seconds

### (Optional) Disarm Key Shares
`disarm_key_shares` specifies the key shares to disarm on startup automatically.

:::danger
This option is dangerous and should be used only for testing purposes or when managing key shares securely.
:::


### Backbone Configuration
`[backbone]` section configures the connection to the Backbone server.

#### Host
`host` specifies the hostname or IP address of the Backbone server.

_example_:
```toml
[backbone]
host = "http://backbone:8080"
```

### Authority Configuration
`[authority]` section allows you to specify the name of the authority.

#### Name
`name` specifies the name of the authority.

:::warning
Ensure that the authority name is unique in the authority server.
:::

_example_:
```toml
[authority]
name = "Authority"
```


### Storage Configuration
`[storage]` section configures the storage backend used by the authority server. Supported storage types are:
- `POSTGRES`: PostgreSQL database
- `FILE`: File-based storage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="POSTGRES" label="PostgreSQL">
  #### Database Configuration
  `[database]` section configures the connection to the PostgreSQL database used to store secrets and metadata.

  ##### Host
  `host` specifies the hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL database server.

  ##### Port
  `port` specifies the port on which the PostgreSQL database server is listening.

  ##### Database Name
  `database_name` specifies the name of the PostgreSQL database.

  ##### Authentication Method
  `auth.method` specifies the authentication method used to connect to the PostgreSQL database. The available options are:
  - `CREDENTIAL`: Uses a username and password for authentication.
  - `RDS_IAM_AUTH`: Uses AWS RDS IAM authentication.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="CREDENTIAL" label="Credential">
  ##### Username
  `auth.username` specifies the username used to authenticate with the PostgreSQL database.
  ##### Password
  `auth.password` specifies the password used to authenticate with the PostgreSQL database.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="RDS_IAM_AUTH" label="AWS RDS IAM">
  #####  Username
  `auth.username` specifies the username used to authenticate with the PostgreSQL database.
      </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="FILE" label="File">
    #### File Configuration
    `[file]` section configures the file-based storage.

    ##### Path
    `path` specifies the path to the directory where the secrets and metadata are stored.

    _example_:
    ```toml
    [storage]
    type = "FILE"
    path = "/var/nebula/path"
    ```

  </TabItem>


</Tabs>


### CORS Configuration
`[cors]` section allows you to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings for the Backbone server. The available options are:
- `ALLOW_ALL`: Allows requests from any origin.
- `ALLOW_LIST`: Allows requests from specific origins. Also, wildcard characters can be used to match multiple origins.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ALLOW_ALL" label="All Origins">
```toml
[cors]
type = "ALLOW_ALL"
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ALLOW_LIST" label="List">
```toml
[cors]
type = "ALLOW_LIST"
domains = ["http://localhost:3000", "https://*.example.com"]
```
:::warning
Wildcard characters should be used only once in the origin URL. (e.g., `https://*.example.com`).

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
