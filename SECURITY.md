# Security Policy

## Supported versions

### New features

New features will only be added to the main branch and will not be made available in point releases.

### Bug fixes

Only the latest release series will receive bug fixes. When enough bugs are fixed and its deemed worthy to release a new gem, this is the branch it happens from.

### Security issues

Only the latest release series will receive patches and new versions in case of a security issue.

### Severe security issues

For severe security issues we will provide new versions as above, and also the last major release series will receive patches and new versions. The classification of the security issue is judged by the core team.

### Unsupported Release Series

When a release series is no longer supported, it's your own responsibility to deal with bugs and security issues. If you are not comfortable maintaining your own versions, you should upgrade to a supported version.

## Reporting a bug

Oracle values the independent security research community and believes that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of all our users.

Please do NOT raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to security@cremit.io preferably with a proof of concept. Please review some additional information on how to report security vulnerabilities to Cremit.
We ask that you do not use other channels or contact the project maintainers directly.

Non-vulnerability related security issues including ideas for new or improved security features are welcome on GitHub Issues.

## Security-related information
We will provide security related information such as a threat model, considerations for secure use, or any known security issues in our documentation. Please note that labs and sample code are intended to demonstrate a concept and may not be sufficiently hardened for production use.
